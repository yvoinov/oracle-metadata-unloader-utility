 UNLOADER INTERNAL NOTES
 =======================

 Important support notes, last minute additions and workarounds.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------

Note 1: On RDBMS 8.1.6.0.0 and 8.1.7.0.0 command "CREATE TABLE AS SELECT" 
------- with lobs generate ORA-600 as shown below. 
        
        RDBMS version 8.1.6.0.0 must be upgraded with patchset 
        at least 8.1.6.2.0 version!
        RDBMS version 8.1.7.0.0 must be upgraded with patchset
        at least 8.1.7.4.0 version!

        Be  sure,  that  after upgrade RDBMS data dictionary common scripts
        was  completed,  as  described  in  patchset documentation or RDBMS
        Migration Guide.

SQL> rem compilation.
SQL> rem Can be re-created from package.
SQL> 
SQL> rem For more performance, uncomment keyword PARALLEL in next statement.
SQL> rem It commented because can produce 
SQL> rem ORA-00600: internal error code, arguments: [QerpxObjMd2]
SQL> rem on some Oracle RDBMS (8.1.6.0.0, 8.1.7.0.0 for example)
SQL>

FROM user_views
     *
ERROR at line 4:
ORA-00600: internal error code, arguments: [QerpxObjMd2], [], [], [], [], [], 
[], [] 

This error produces by bug in PX IPC intercommunication.


Note 2: Beware, that WRAPPED code different on 8.0, 8i, 9i, 10g RDBMS releases.
------- Use correctly version from version-specific directory. Also be ware, 
        that wrapped code from 8.x-9.x RDBMS can correctly executed on RDBMS 10.x.
        But wrapped code from RDBMS 10.x CAN'T!


Note 3: FOR WINDOWS NT/2000 USERS (IN DISTRIBUTED ENVIRONMENT) - If GLOBAL_NAMES 
------- initialization parameter is TRUE or TNS-alias in tnsnames.ora in 
        simplified form (without DB-domain) , CREATE SYNONYM command can be
        unloaded with Windows domain name by default. 
        Correct unloaded script manually, these synonyms cannot be created! 
        It never ever taking place in UNIX platforms with disabled parameter 
        GLOBAL_NAMES and full qualified TNS-aliases with default DB-domains. 
        Anyway, check unloaded synonyms script for correctness BEFORE running.
